Not less than one year ago began to pry the design of interfaces. On the same date appeared "Ubuntu Touch". My first steps on this platform, which is still in development, maybe that's why I started to distribute this graphic kit. After 10 months, the kit has reached its 10th version and with it a brand image, a new name, more optimization, new guides and more users testing this. I am very glad that this is helpful to the community and new users come to the platform. Design is very beautiful, but it's even more beautiful when you share. 

Thanks to those who have encouraged me to release a new version every month.


**The kit includes most of the elements to recreate any part of an application for Ubuntu. Headers, buttons, footer, actions, styles, text, gestures, text fields, list items, option selectors, sliders, toogles, progress bars, popovers, dialogues, sheets, masks, keyboard, multiple devices, dock , notes, color palette and a small tutorial to help those newbies.**

**With this kit you can project your application for Ubuntu. Diagrams, workflow, navigation, visual design, check dimensions in your phone and other things that will surely be of great help. 
The Kit is systematized to make the slightest effort to design your app.**

Show us what you can do with it.
